      <p>There are a few YouTube channels that I watch fairly regularly that have recently been making some truly beautiful visualisations of the Fourier transform. The visualisations really were beautiful (I'll link to them in the text) not only aesthetically but also in how they intuitively show what the Fourier transform works and what it achieves. I was inspired to try to replicate the visualisation procedure and the code inside this post is a python implementation of the method. The approach itself in truth isn't terribly complicated, but I find the outcome hypnotic!</p>

      <p>It was recently shown that neural ordinary differential equation models cannot solve fundamental and seemingly straightforward tasks even with high-capacity vector field representations. This paper introduces two other fundamental tasks to the set that baseline methods cannot solve, and proposes mixtures of stochastic vector fields as a model class that is capable of solving these essential problems. Dynamic vector field selection is of critical importance for our model, and our approach is to propagate component uncertainty over the integration interval with a technique based on forward filtering. We also formalise several loss functions that encourage desirable properties on the trajectory paths, and of particular interest are those that directly encourage fewer expected function evaluations. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our model class is capable of capturing the natural dynamics of human behaviour; a notoriously volatile application area. Baseline approaches cannot adequately model this problem.</p>

      <p>This paper extends the class of ordinal regression models with a structured interpretation of the problem by applying a novel treatment of encoded labels. The net effect of this is to transform the underlying problem from an ordinal regression task to a (structured) classification task which we solve with conditional random fields, thereby achieving a coherent and probabilistic model in which all model parameters are jointly learnt. Importantly, we show that although we have cast ordinal regression to classification, our method still fall within the class of decomposition methods in the ordinal regression ontology. This is an important link since our experience is that many applications of machine learning to healthcare ignores completely the important nature of the label ordering, and hence these approaches should considered naive in this ontology. We also show that our model is flexible both in how it adapts to data manifolds and in terms of the operations that are available for practitioner to execute. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach overwhelmingly produces superior and often statistically significant results over baseline approaches on forty popular ordinal regression models, and demonstrate that the proposed model significantly out-performs baselines on synthetic and real datasets. Our implementation, together with scripts to reproduce the results of this work, will be available on a public GitHub repository.</p>

      <p>Active Learning (AL) refers to the setting where the learner has the ability to perform queries to an oracle to acquire the true label of an instance or, sometimes, a set of instances. Even though Active Learning has been studied extensively, the setting is usually restricted to assume that the oracle is trustworthy and will provide the actual label. We argue that, while common, this approach can be made more flexible to account for different forms of supervision. In this paper, we propose a new framework that allows the algorithm to request the label for a bag of samples at a time. Although this label will come in the form of proportions of class labels in the bags and therefore encode less information, we demonstrate that we can still learn effectively.</p>

      <p>This study is concerned with astronomical time-series called light-curves that represent the brightness of celestial objects over a period of time. We consider the task of finding anomalous light-curves of periodic variable stars. We employ a Hierarchical Gaussian Process to create a general and stable model of time-series for anomaly detection, and apply this approach to the light-curve problem. Hierarchical Gaussian Processes require only a few additional parameters compared to conventional Gaussian Processes and incur negligible additional computational complexity. Moreover, since the additional parameters are objectively optimised in a principled probabilistic framework one does not need to resort to grid searches for parameter selection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several baselines on both synthetic and light-curve data. Of particular interest is that the proposed method generalises very well from small subsets of the data, achieving near perfect precision of outlier detection even with as few as seven instances.</p>

      <p>Learning with Label Proportions (LLP) is the problem of recovering the underlying true labels given a dataset when the data is presented in the form of bags. This paradigm is particularly suitable in contexts where providing individual labels is expensive and label aggregates are more easily obtained. In the healthcare domain, it is a burden for a patient to keep a detailed diary of their daily routines, but often they will be amenable to provide higher level summaries of daily behavior. We present a novel and efficient graph-based algorithm that encourages local smoothness and exploits the global structure of the data, while preserving the ‘mass’ of each bag.</p>

We describe, from a data-science perspective, our experience of taking the system out of the laboratory into more than thirty homes in Bristol, UK. We describe the infrastructure and processes that had to be developed along the way, describe how we train and deploy Machine Learning systems in this context, and give a realistic appraisal of the state of the deployed systems.</p>

      <p>The SPHERE project has developed a multi-modal sensor platform for health and behavior monitoring in residential environments. So far, the SPHERE platform has been deployed for data collection in approximately 50 homes for duration up to one year. This technical document describes the format and the expected content of the SPHERE dataset (s) under preparation. It includes a list of some data quality problems (both known to exist in the dataset (s) and potential ones), their workarounds, and other information important to people working with the SPHERE data, software, and hardware. This document does not aim to be an exhaustive descriptor of the SPHERE dataset (s); it also does not aim to discuss or validate the potential scientific uses of the SPHERE data.</p>

      <p>High computational complexity is often a barrier to achieving desired representations in resource-constrained settings. This paper introduces a simple and computationally cheap method of approximating complex features. We do so by carefully constraining the architecture of Neural Networks (NNs) and regress from raw data to the intended feature representation. Our analysis focuses on spectral features, and demonstrates how low-capacity networks can capture the end-to-end dynamics of cascaded composite functions. Not only do approximating NNs simplify the analysis pipeline, but our approach produces feature representations up to 20 times more quickly. Excellent feature fidelity is achieved in our experimental analysis with feature approximations, but we also report nearly indistinguishable predictive performance when comparing between exact and approximate representations</p>

      <p>This paper serves as a survey and empirical evaluation of the state-of-the-art in activity recognition methods using accelerometers. The paper is particularly focused on long-term activity recognition in real-world settings. In these environments, data collection is not a trivial matter; thus, there are performance trade-offs between prediction accuracy, which is not the sole system objective, and keeping the maintenance overhead at minimum levels. We examine research that has focused on the selection of activities, the features that are extracted from the accelerometer data, the segmentation of the time-series data, the locations of accelerometers, the selection and configuration trade-offs, the test/retest reliability, and the generalisation performance.</p>
