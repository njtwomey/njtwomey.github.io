      <p>There has been significant recent interest in sensing systems and ‘smart environments’, with a number of longitudinal studies in this area. Typically the goal of these studies is to develop methods to predict, at any one moment of time, the activity or activities that the resident(s) of the home are engaged in, which may in turn be used for determining normal or abnormal patterns of behaviour (e.g. in a health-care setting). Classification algorithms, such as Conditional Random Field (CRFs), typically consider sensor activations as features but these are often treated as if they were independent, which in general they are not. Our hypothesis is that learning patterns based on combinations of sensors will be more powerful than single sensors alone.</p>

      <p>There is a widely-accepted need to revise current forms of health-care provision, with particular interest in sensing systems in the home. Given a multiple-modality sensor platform with heterogeneous network connectivity, as is under development in the Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in Residential Environment (SPHERE) Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC), we face specific challenges relating to the fusion of the heterogeneous sensor modalities. We introduce Bayesian models for sensor fusion, which aims to address the challenges of fusion of heterogeneous sensor modalities. Using this approach we are able to identify the modalities that have most utility for each particular activity, and simultaneously identify which features within that activity are most relevant for a given activity.</p>

      <p>We introduce and analyse a flexible and efficient implementation of Bayesian dictionary learning for sparse coding. By placing Gaussian-inverse-Gamma hierarchical priors on the coefficients, the model can automatically determine the required sparsity level for good reconstructions, whilst also automatically learning the noise level in the data, obviating the need for heuristic methods for choosing sparsity levels. This model can be solved efficiently using Variational Message Passing (VMP), which we have implemented in the Infer.NET framework for probabilistic programming and inference. We analyse the properties of the model via empirical validation on several accelerometer datasets. We provide source code to replicate all of the experiments in this paper.</p>

      <p>There is no uniform approach in the literature for modelling sequential correlations in sequence classification problems. It is easy to find examples of unstructured models (e.g. logistic regression) where correlations are not taken into account at all, but there are also many examples where the correlations are explicitly incorporated into a—potentially computationally expensive—structured classification model (e.g. conditional random fields). In this paper we lay theoretical and empirical foundations for clarifying the types of problem which necessitate direct modelling of correlations in sequences, and the types of problem where unstructured models that capture sequential aspects solely through features are sufficient. The theoretical work in this paper shows that the rate of decay of auto-correlations within a sequence is related to the excess classification risk that is incurred by ignoring the structural aspect of the data.</p>

      <p>This paper outlines the Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in Residential Environment (SPHERE) project and details the SPHERE challenge that will take place in conjunction with European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery (ECML-PKDD) between March and July 2016. The SPHERE challenge is an activity recognition competition where predictions are made from video, accelerometer and environmental sensors. Monetary prizes will be awarded to the top three entrants, with Euro 1,000 being awarded to the winner, Euro 600 being awarded to the first runner up, and Euro 400 being awarded to the second runner up.</p>

      <p>Typically, when analysing patterns of activity in a smart home environment, the daily patterns of activity are either ignored completely or summarised into a high-level hour-of-day feature that is then combined with sensor activities. However, when summarising the temporal nature of an activity into a coarse feature such as this, not only is information lost after discretisation, but also the strength of the periodicity of the action is ignored. We propose to model the temporal nature of activities using circular statistics, and in particular by performing Bayesian inference with Wrapped Normal (WN) and WN Mixture (WNM) models. We firstly demonstrate the accuracy of inference on toy data using both Gibbs sampling and Expectation Propagation (EP), and then show the results of the inference on publicly available smart-home data. Such models can be useful for analysis or prediction in their own right, or can be readily combined with larger models incorporating multiple modalities of sensor activity.</p>
